                    <h3>Laughter is a Workout</h3>
                    <p>Laughing 100 times is roughly equivalent to 15 minutes of exercise on a stationary bike. It
                        boosts your immune system, lowers stress hormones, and triggers the release of endorphins (the
                        body's natural feel-good chemicals). So, watching a comedy is technically "leg day" for your
                        face.</p>

                    <h3>The Rubber Chicken</h3>
                    <p>The origin of the "rubber chicken" as a comedy prop is unknown, but it likely originated in the
                        burlesque shows of the 1900s to mock the food served at dinner theater.</p>

                    <h3>Chaplin Lost!</h3>
                    <p>Charlie Chaplin once entered a "Charlie Chaplin Look-Alike Contest" in San Francisco... and came
                        in 20th place. The judges reportedly told him he "lacked the look."</p>

                    <h3>Dying of Laughter</h3>
                    <p>It is actually possible. In 1975, a man named Alex Mitchell laughed continuously for 25 minutes
                        while watching the show <em>The Goodies</em> and suffered a heart failure.</p>

                    <h3>The Canned Laughter</h3>
                    <p>The "Laugh Track" was invented in the 1950s by sound engineer Charley Douglass. He hated when
                        live audiences laughed at the wrong moments, so he built a "keyboard" that played different
                        laughs. Even today, many sitcoms use laughs recorded in the 1950s—meaning we are listening to
                        dead people laugh.</p>

                    <h3>The Banana Peel</h3>
                    <p>Why bananas? In the late 19th century, rotting banana peels were a legitimate public hazard in
                        New York City streets. It wasn't just a joke; it was a PSA!</p>
